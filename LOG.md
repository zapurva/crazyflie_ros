Waypoint navigation using ROS
=============================
# Getting started
* Noticed that Crazyflie in hover mode with Optitrack for localization as described in [1] does not work. 
* Created branch wpt_nav_stuff for debugging. 

## TODO:
-- tf between Motive and ROS not set. Transforming manually for now
